To compile and flash this .ino file to the board:

- Copy Cape.ino from this Cape directory to the libraries directory
- From within the Arduino IDE:
  - add the FastSPI_LED2.cpp library i
  - open Cape.ino
  - it will ask you to create a sketch folder, which it will move the file into

Then you are good to upload. 

For the 2013 Burning Man cape, we're using the Arduino Nano.
