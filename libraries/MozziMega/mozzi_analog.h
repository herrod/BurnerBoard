efficient way to read analog inputs while generating sound with Mozzi. For many
sketches, however, simply putting setupFastAnalogRead() in setup() and calling
Arduino's usual analogRead() will work fast enough.

It may cause the ADC process to hog the processor, causing audio glitches.

interrupt interfering with the audio or control interrupts. If this occurs, use
the adcStartConversion(), adcGetResult() methods instead.

/**  @ingroup analog
Prepare an analog input channel by turning off its digital input buffer.
This helps to reduce noise, increase analog reading speed, and save power.

Here's more detail from http://www.openmusiclabs.com/learning/digital/atmega-adc/:

The DIDR (Data Input Disable Register) disconnects the digital inputs from
whichever ADC channels you are using. This is important for 2 reasons. First
off, an analog input will be floating all over the place, and causing the
digital input to constantly toggle high and low. This creates excessive noise
near the ADC, and burns extra power. Secondly, the digital input and associated
DIDR switch have a capacitance associated with them which will slow down your
input signal if you are sampling a highly resistive load.

And from the ATmega328p datasheet, p266:

When an analog signal is applied to the ADC pin and the digital input from
this pin is not needed, this bit should be written logic one to reduce power
consumption in the digital input buffer. Note that ADC named_pins ADC7 
and ADC6 do not have digital input buffers, and therefore do not require 
Digital Input Disable bits.
@param channel_num the analog input channel you wish to use.

/** @ingroup analog
Starts an analog to digital conversion of the voltage at a specified pin.  Unlike
Arduino's analogRead() function which waits until a conversion is complete before
returning, adcStartConversion() only sets the conversion to begin, so you can use
the cpu for other things and call for the result later with adcGetResult().
This works well in updateControl(), where you can call adcStartConversion() and
get the result with adcGetResult() the next time the updateControl()
interrupt runs.
@param pin is the analog pin number (A0 to A...) or the channel number (0 to ....) to read.
@note This is the most audio-friendly way to read analog inputs,

have happened in between interrupts.  This is a big time-saver, since you don't have to
waste time waiting for analogRead() to return (1us here vs 105 us for standard Arduino).

all channels on each kind of board. You can change the number of channels to use in
mozzi_analog.cpp by editing NUM_ANALOG_INPUTS if desired.

/*
Currently, if audio input is enabled it uses analog input channel 0 and doesn't
allow other channels to be used, to avoid interference between the strict audio
rate sampling and any control analog conversions which could be in progress when
the audio needs to be sampled. This might be solved in future, but workable
solutions for control inputs include RC circuits on digital pins, switches, or
serial connections (which also may require extra solutions for asynchronous
operation). There is a fork of Mozzi on github (posted on the mozzi-users list)
which includes a 2-wire async serial adaptation. It would be good eventually to
merge that with the main repo.

// these are in adc_all_channels.cpp with the ISR(ADC_vect) they work with.  The ISR needs to
// hide from the compiler if USE_AUDIO_INPUT is true, which also uses ISR(ADC_vect).
// They could have been conditionally compiled together in the one ISR, but this is slightly 
// less messy and allows for some static variables which would otherwise have had to have been global.


/** @ingroup analog
Call adcReadAllChannels() in updateControl() and the results for each channel
will be available by calling adcGetResult(channel_num) next time updateControl()
runs. Reading will happen in the background, using a minimum of processor time
and without blocking other code.

More detail: adcReadAllChannels() starts an initial conversion which triggers an
interrupt when it's complete. The interrupt code stores the result in an array,
changes to the next channel and starts another conversion. When all the channels
have been sampled, the ISR doesn't start a new conversion, so it doesn't
re-trigger itself or use processor time until adcReadAllChannels() is called
again. At any time the latest conversion result for each channel is available by
calling adcGetResult(channel_num).
